About me
--------

Hello! My name is Andrey. I'm a programmer and software developer located in Osaka, Japan.

I am a web developer with a strong passion to build rock solid applications: secure, reliable, fast.

Mostly I'm programming in Ruby ([Ruby on Rails] framework) with heavy reliance on the [PostgreSQL].

I love open source ideology, use and improve open source products wherever and whenever I can. I have contributed to such projects as [Ruby on Rails] and even created my own Ruby gems like [Yabeda](https://github.com/yabeda-rb/) or [After Commit Everywhere](https://github.com/Envek/after_commit_everywhere). See [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/Envek) for more.


Blog posts
----------

I've written a bunch of blog posts at [Martian chronicles](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/) (in English), at [Habr.com](https://habr.com/ru/users/envek/posts/) (in Russian), in my personal blog (right [here](./blog/)), and even [some Twitter threads](https://getchirrapp.com/@Envek) on Twitter.
